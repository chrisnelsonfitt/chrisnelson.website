    <h1>DeanaJ
         Photography</h1>
    <p>This is a project I worked on awhile ago for a photographer. The major focus on this site was to create a lightbox to showcase the photography. I used bootstrap to to create the navigation for this project. The slides on the homepage were created using a Jquery plugin and the Lightbox effect was created using JavaScript. I also used PHP for the form submit.
