    <h1>Accessibility</h1>
        <p> This was a project I completed for Treehouse. I was given a site that was lacking basic accessibility, I was expected to correct the issues using best practices. </p>

      <h4> Highlights:</h4>
    <ul>
        <li>Chrome accessibility tools</li>
        <li>Site Update</li>
    </ul>
